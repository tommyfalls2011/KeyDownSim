  "summary": "Dual SWR feature fully verified. All 7 metrics visible in MetricsPanel (Power, Peak, SWR Radio, SWR Ant, Amp Volts, Take-Off, Amp Temp). Dual SWR readouts show both radio-end SWR and antenna-end SWR, correctly implementing the 'liar factor' where feedline loss makes SWR appear lower at radio. SWR values respond correctly to config changes (bonding, vehicle, antenna type). Yagi mode also works with dual SWR readouts.",
